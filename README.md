Given a comment, identify the following labels associated with it:  Toxic, Severetoxic, Obscene, threat, Insult, Identityhate.
This is a multi-label classification, meaning, that a comment can belong to zero or more labels at the same time. The evauation metric used has been mean column-wise ROC AUC. I used TextCNN to solve the given task.

I got a Private Score of 0.96468 and Public Score of 0.96557.
